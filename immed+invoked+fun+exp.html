        // IIFE it is a javascript function that runs as soon as it is defiend.

        // It is a design pattern which is also known as Self-Executing Anonymous function and contain two major parts . The first is the anonymous function with lexical scope enclosed within the grouping operator().This prevents accessing variables within the IIFE idiom as well as polluting the global scope .

        //The second part is creating the immediatly executing function expression(), through which the javascript engine will directly interpret th efunction.

        // 1> Avoid creating global variable and function.
        // 2> As it doesn't variable and function globally so there will be no name confilicts.
        // 3> Scope is limited so that particular function.

        //  document.write(a); we can not access this var outside the fucntion.
